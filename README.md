## Installation ⚙️

### Set Up a Python Virtual Environment

To ensure that you have an isolated environment for running the script and installing dependencies, it’s highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

#### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to your project folder and create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv

This will create a folder called `venv` in your project directory.

#### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

- **On Linux/macOS:**

  source venv/bin/activate

- **On Windows:**

  .\venv\Scripts\activate

You should see `(venv)` appear in your terminal prompt, indicating the virtual environment is active.

---

### Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, you can install the necessary Python dependencies.

1. First, create a `requirements.txt` file with the following contents:

yt-dlp
pyfiglet

2. Then, run the following command to install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

### Install FFmpeg

FFmpeg is required for video conversion. To install FFmpeg:

- **On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ffmpeg

- **On macOS (using Homebrew):**

  brew install ffmpeg

- **On Windows:**
  1. Download FFmpeg from [FFmpeg Official Site](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).
  2. Extract the files and add the bin folder to your system's PATH.

---

## Usage 🎬

### Running the Script

Once everything is set up, you can run the `DownloadTube` script. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.

1. Run the script:

python DownloadTube.py

2. Follow the prompts:
   - Enter the **YouTube URL** or **Shorts link**.
   - Optionally view **available qualities** before downloading.
   - Choose the **format** (MP4 or MP3).
   - Choose a **download location**.

---

### Sample Output

Enter the YouTube URL or Shorts link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcd1234
Do you want to see available qualities? (y/n): y
Available qualities for video: Sample Video
18 - 720p - mp4
22 - 1080p - mp4
Do you want to download in MP4 or MP3? (mp4/mp3): mp4
Enter the folder path where you want to save the video (default is current folder):

The video will begin downloading in the chosen format and quality.
